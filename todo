- organize api code into dif mod [WIP]
- Find way to only create tokio runtime once [WIP]
- Probably make it possible to query both claude and chatgpt at same time. Then aggregate both answers into one big one using claude?
- try writing it out word by word / char by char to simulate claude / gpt writing?]
    chatgpt may have a streaming option that I think will work
    attach visible bool to each word or char, then we just switch them to true in succession? if char visible, display it? Is that possible?
- something that lets user know chat bot is thinking (while waiting for answers)
- dark theme ?
- Change style to look more like a chat app
- make chat row not take up full width if text content doesn't need full width
- when incoming chat arrives, scroll window down to accomodate it?
- allow cmd+v paste / cmd+c copy / word select
- Allow user to enter own api key / handle persistence

- make chats start from bottom of page and build up [DONE]
- Try to get Spotify api working with it --> when you enter in entry, it returns info on artist you entered [DONE]
