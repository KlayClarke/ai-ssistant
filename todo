- try writing it out word by word / char by char to simulate claude / gpt writing?]
    anthropic has a streaming option that I think will work
    attach visible bool to each word or char, then we just switch them to true in succession? if char visible, display it? Is that possible?
- something that lets user know claude is thinking
- dark theme ?
- Change style to look more like a chat app
- make chat row not take up full width if text content doesn't need full width
- when incoming chat arrives, scroll window down to accomodate it?
- allow cmd+v paste / cmd+c copy / word select
- use TextView instead of Entry to ensure when text overflows entry, it make entry taller
- Find way to only create tokio runtime once
- Allow user to enter own api key / handle persistence
- Probably make it possible to query both claude and chatgpt at same time. Then aggregate both answers into one big one using claude?
- organize api code into dif mod
